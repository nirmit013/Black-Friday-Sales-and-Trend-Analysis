# 🛒 Black Friday Sales and Trends Analysis

This project analyzes **Black Friday sales data** to uncover trends in customer behavior and build predictive models for purchase amounts.  
The work is divided into two phases: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Predictive Modeling**.  

---

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Perform **EDA** to identify key sales patterns and customer demographics.  
- Visualize trends using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
- Build and compare **machine learning models** to predict purchase amounts.  
- Evaluate performance of baseline regressors vs. **XGBoost**.  
- Provide actionable insights for retail decision-making.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `BFTA_Phase1.ipynb` → Data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.  
- `BTFA_Phase2.ipynb` → Feature engineering, regression models, and XGBoost predictions.  
- `Readme.pdf` → PDF report summarizing methodology and findings.  
- `requirements.txt` → List of Python libraries required to run the project.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and documentation  

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **Customer demographics** (age, gender, occupation, marital status) show strong influence on purchase behavior.  
- Seasonal trends highlight **spending spikes during festival periods**.  
- **XGBoost outperformed baseline models**, delivering the most accurate purchase predictions.
